# web-tutorial

A comprehensive Clojure web development training template using Clerk notebooks.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/rc/web-tutorial

## Training Content

This project contains a complete training curriculum for learning web development with Clojure:

1. **01_starting_web_server.clj** - Introduction to basic web servers
2. **02_starting_ring_server.clj** - Building Ring-based web applications
3. **03_adding_simple_middleware.clj** - Creating and using middleware
4. **04_demonstrating_middleware_functionality.clj** - Understanding middleware chains
5. **05_adding_swagger_support.clj** - API documentation with Swagger
6. **06_malli_spec_usage.clj** - Data validation with Malli

## Usage

### Running Clerk Notebooks

To view and interact with the training notebooks:

```bash
clojure -M:clerk
```

This will start Clerk server at http://localhost:7777 where you can browse the notebooks.

### Running the Project Directly

Run the project directly, via `:exec-fn`:

    $ clojure -X:run-x
    Hello, Clojure!

Run the project, overriding the name to be greeted:

    $ clojure -X:run-x :name '"Someone"'
    Hello, Someone!

Run the project directly, via `:main-opts` (`-m rc.web-tutorial`):

    $ clojure -M:run-m
    Hello, World!

Run the project, overriding the name to be greeted:

    $ clojure -M:run-m Via-Main
    Hello, Via-Main!

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/web-tutorial-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Dependencies

The training template includes:

- **Ring** - Web application interface
- **Reitit** - Fast data-driven router with Swagger support
- **Malli** - Schema specification and validation
- **Clerk** - Scientific notebook environment for interactive development

## Training Path

The notebooks are designed to be completed in order:

1. Start with basic web server concepts
2. Progress to Ring applications with routing
3. Learn about middleware patterns
4. Explore middleware functionality in depth
5. Add API documentation with Swagger
6. Implement comprehensive data validation with Malli

Each notebook builds upon the concepts from the previous ones, providing a comprehensive introduction to Clojure web development.
